# Prediction of Customers Likely to Drop Bank Services 

Neural Network model designed to predict customer churn, optimizing for accuracy and computational efficiency.

Summary:

Is it possible to predict -which customers are highly likely to leave the bank within 6 months? I will design a ANN to answer the question.

A bank services dataset will be used to analyze customer behaviours and tendencies.

The following observations were extracted using statistical libraries against this bank's dataset: 

- The average Age of all Customers is 39 years.
- 75% of Customers have been with the bank for about 7 years with and average of 5 years.
- The average Customer balance is 76.5k.
- 70% of all Customers have Credit Cards.
- The average salary of Customers is 100k.
- 50% of Customers are from France and the remaining half are equally divided between Germany and Spain.

Recommendations:

- Right off the bat, bank offerings must include services in three languages: French, German and Spanish.
- There are twice as many French customers, therefore the marketing and customer support and customer retention budgets should reflect the same.
- Bots or AI assistants should provide culture and language sensitivity to reflect customer's distribution.
- Important: EU AI Act applies to all 3 countries and the bank must follow these regulations with strict compliance.
